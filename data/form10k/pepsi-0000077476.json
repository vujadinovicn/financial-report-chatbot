    "item1a": "Item 1A.  Risk Factors.\n The following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. These are not the only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that may become material in the future.\n Business Risks\n Risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine\n The deadly conflict in Ukraine and related sanctions have continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our\n 11\n \n Table ofContents\n Table of\n Contents\n information systems, reputational risk, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging and raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets, including the nationalization or expropriation of assets, result in additional impairment charges or significantly affect our ability to manage our operations in these markets which could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, operations, customers, consumers or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business.\n Reduction in future demand for our products would adversely affect our business.\n Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to innovate and anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase and consume them. Consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics, consumption patterns, diet (whether due to changes in consumer behavior and eating habits, the use of weight-loss drugs or other factors) and channel preferences (including continued increases in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels); pricing; product quality; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use and other plastic packaging); and concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile and health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid). Concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or publicly boycott the purchase or consumption of our products. Pandemics, epidemics or other disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, and geopolitical events, wars and other military conflicts have also impacted and could continue to impact consumer preferences and demand for our products. Consumer preferences are also influenced by perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products, the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer, including through the use of digital media or assets, and the perception of our use of social media and our response to political and social issues, geopolitical events, wars and other military conflicts or catastrophic events. These and other factors have reduced and could continue to reduce consumers' willingness to purchase certain of our products, including as a result of public boycotts. Any inability on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic investments to do so, including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, lead to inventory write-offs or erode our competitive and financial position, thereby adversely affecting our business. In addition, our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by geopolitical events, wars and other military conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively mitigate these issues.\n Damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business.\n Maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure by us, our business partners, or other actors in the supply chain to maintain high ethical, business and environmental, social and governance practices, including with respect to human rights, child labor, diversity, equity and inclusion, workplace conditions and employee health and safety; any failure, or\n 12\n perception of a failure, to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals, or any negative perception toward such goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, packaging, water use and our impact on the environment; any failure to address health or other concerns about our products, products we distribute (including alcoholic beverages), or particular ingredients in our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity and other health conditions or an increase in public health costs; our research and development efforts; any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of any of our products; any failure to comply with laws and regulations; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, marketing programs, use of social media and our response to political and social issues, geopolitical events, wars and other military conflicts or catastrophic events; or any failure to effectively respond to negative or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business.\n Product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business.\n We have recalled, and could in the future recall, products due to product quality or safety issues, including actual or alleged mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, undeclared allergens, adulteration or contamination. Joint ventures in which we have an interest have also recalled, and could in the future recall, products for the same or other reasons. Product recalls, including the voluntary recall of certain bars and cereals in our QFNA division (Quaker Recall), have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost, the destruction of product inventory, customer fines and returns or lost sales due to any unavailability of the product for a period of time. In addition, product quality or safety issues have in the past and could in the future also reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruption",
